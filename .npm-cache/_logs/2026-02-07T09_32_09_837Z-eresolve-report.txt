# npm resolution error report

While resolving: ainews-control-center@0.1.0
Found: react@19.2.4
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.2.3" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"15 - 18" from react-joyride@2.9.3
node_modules/react-joyride
  react-joyride@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
